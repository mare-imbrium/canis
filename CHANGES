Made some changes in getchar to return STRINGS but not implemented. Evaluating benefits
in moving to chars, and how to go about.

2014-04-23 - 00:23 

removed many dead methods from window and some from widget
slight changes in button and label : when_form replaced by FORM_ATTACHED

2014-05-05 - 20:12 

- moved to new cleaner method of reading keys from keyboard
- Added ButtonGroup for RadioButtons.
- removed Bottomline and enhanced rcommandline instead

2014-05-09 - 22:23 

- introduced layouts. Now a user can hardcode locations of widgets or use a layout
  to do the same. A layout is able to handle a resize of the screen.

- Major rewrite of colorparser. now colors are not hardcoded while parsing. We now store link
  to parent chunk, so that a change in textpads color can affect the pad without a re-parse.
  Parent's color's are resolved at render time.

2014-05-31 - 18:20 
- minor changes that could result in some color related issues with buttons or other widgets
  - repaint in various widgets no longer sets @bgcolor and @color, it uses the method
    Same with @attr. messagebox also does not set the color variables but uses the method
  - clear_pad clear_row uses content_cols i/o width so complete pad is cleared.
    Also i have put a return in the middle, i think the second part of clear is redundant
    now, if the first half works properly.

2014-06-06 - 00:05 
- Released 0.0.1

2014-06-19 - 17:16 
- Still trying to simplify and refactor TextPad so there are no changes for a fairly long time.
- Removed content_type complexity into TextDocument so Textpad can be dumb.

Built 0.0.2 but i did not release it.

2014-07-09 - 22:48 
- for 0.0.3
  - removed label string from Field and moved to LabeledField
    This change has an impact in many examples, and combo
  - some changes in creation of $log so that if none specified then it can go to /dev/null
    This way an app can have its own logger and not bother about canis' logging.
    Or it can merge the two.
  - Moved helpmanager from rwidgets to its own file. Needs to be refactored and cleaned up.

2014-08-18 - 17:11 
- for 0.0.5
  - fixed a bug in handling of multiple key assignments due to which extra keys pushed onto stack
  - App keyblock yields string of key without changing or converting to symbol

2014-09-01 
- for 0.0.6
  - Statusline location defaults to -1 from bottom, earlier -3
  - Statusline attrib was A_REVERSE earlier, now defaults to A_NORMAL.
  - bugs and omissions in parse_format, and in DefaultColorParser fixed.

2014-09-02

  rdialog.rb introduced a syntax error while adding names to windows, had to yank 0.0.6

2014-09-11 
- for 0.0.8
